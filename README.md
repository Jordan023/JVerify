JVerify
=======

An application to create MD5 and SHA-1 hashes.

Foldertracking
=======

The main power of this tool is the ability to track file changes and MD5/Sha-1-sums inside of specified folders. Everytime you add something to the folder, the application will update the MD5's or SHA's in regular intervals and add it to a manifest. Leaving you with nothing to worry about.

Future plans
=======

Future plans are to create automated Chain of Evidence tracking (some more advanced file tracking ).
